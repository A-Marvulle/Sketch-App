# The Processing Library

A **library** is a shareable collection of code written for a specific purpose. We use libraries so that we don't have to write everything from scratch in all of our programs.

Processing is a library which helps us draw shapes, lines, and text to a window on your computer screen. This provides us with a helpful starting point to begin creating our sketch app.

Check out Processing's website where you can find reference material about its functionality, and see examples of other projects people have built with the library.

### Including Processing in our project

In the `lib` folder in our `Files` tab, you can see the Processing core library `core-3.3.7`. This is a compressed file with the compiled source code for the library. We aren't able to read this code directly, but by including this in our project files we gain access to the library.

## Running a Processing App

We've provided you with a bit of starter code just to get the ball rolling.

Press the Run button at the top-center of the window, you will see a **canvas** appear in the `Output` tab.

Choose the `sidebar` button on the left then look in the `Files` tab. You should see a source code folder named `src` then another folder called `sketchpad`. In there you will see the `Main.java` file which serves as the entry point for our program.

Main is set up to run the `Sketchpad.java` file which is where we will be writing most of our code for this project. Right now, the sketchpad is mostly empty and so our program simply displays a blank canvas window.
