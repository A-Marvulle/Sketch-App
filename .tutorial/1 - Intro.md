# Starbust Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn to make use of an "update" method, which Processing will call once per frame. (Typically aiming for 60 frames per second). With a continuously updating method, we can begin to make our applications interactive.

On our way towards creating a working pen tool for our sketch app, we will be making an interactive "starburst" pattern where colored lines are drawn once per frame from the center of our sketchpad to the mouse cursor.

## Key Concepts
- Update methods
- Method Overloading
- Return values

## Lesson Objective

We've seen how to call methods in order to have them perform actions, now we're going to take a look at another critical use of methods, which is to have them **return** data. 

Many programs will contain methods which perform computations whose resultant value can be used later in the program or returned to the user. 

In this lesson, we will make use of methods which return data about the user's mouse position, and use that data to inform our drawing calls.
