# Building a Sketch App

In this course we will be designing a Sketch App which will allow us to draw colored lines on the screen with our mouse. This course is designed to demonstrate the foundations of programming with Java.

*The concepts learned here will be immediately applicable to any programming application you may find yourself working on in the future.*

## Key Concepts
- Libraries
- Calling methods
- Passing values

## Lesson Objective

In this lesson we will learn to call **methods**, which are actions our program is able to perform, in order to draw shapes and color on our screen.
