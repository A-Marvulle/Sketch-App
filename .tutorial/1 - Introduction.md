# Building a Drawing Pen

It's finally time! In this lesson, we will begin development of a pen tool which will allow us to draw lines with our mouse over the canvas. In doing so, we will learn to store data within **variables**, and will begin to understand Java as a "statically typed language".

## Key Concepts

- Variable Access, Update, and Storage
- Data Types
- Code Comments

## Lesson Objective

Variables are a foundation of building programs. You will use them to store, manipulate, and transfer data. You will learn that Java is a typed language: all entities in Java are of a defined **type** and are stored and referenced in **variables**.

In this lesson, we will learn to define and access variables of a specific type.
