# Beautifying the Background with Loops

We've now completed the foundations of our drawing app. We can call this our MVP, minimum viable product, congrats! We can now build off of this foundation to add more features and personality to the application.

In this lesson, we will add an arrangement of colorful circles to our background border to make our application look a bit more fun.

## Key Concepts

- For Loops
- Defining Methods
- The D.R.Y Principle - Don't Repeat Yourself

## Lesson Objectives: Applications of Loops

We will be learning to use **for loops** a powerful type of control structure which allows us to instruct our program to repeat a certain action several times. If we can define drawing a single colored circle at a random position on the background, then we can use a **for loop** to draw as many circles as we'd like.

This extends to any action, in programming, we often need a certain action repeated many times. We may want to display a list of all 200 user in our database. Or we might need to sample the brightness value of every pixel in an image processing app. Each of these examples describes a single action repeated several times.
