# Introduction

We've seen so far a bit about the natural flow of program code. We have a list of instructions which are read and performed from top to bottom. We've also seen a small taste of **program control** in that the `update` method is automatically called once per frame, and the `initialLaunch` method is automatically called once after the Run button is pressed.

In this lesson we will learn to use a powerful **control structure** called an `if-statement`. If-statements allow us to tell the application "only run this section of code if this condition is true".

## Key Concepts

- Conditions
- Boolean Logic
- Control Structures

## Lesson Objective: Conditionals in Programming

You will see this structure used ubiquitously within applications. "Only login the user **if** their password is correct", "display a 404 page **if** the user navigates to a page that doesn't exist".

In the following steps, we will use if-statements to control our pen by checking for two **conditions**.
1. The user is holding down the left mouse button.
2. The mouse is within the white sketchpad region in our canvas.
