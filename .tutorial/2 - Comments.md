# Code Comments

In this day, we will be incrementally adding and removing sections of our code as we progress. To help identify where in your code to add new lines, the instructions will use comments to indicate.

A comment in code is a note that is ignored by the computer but intended to be read by developers. A comment can be created by first writing `//` followed by the comment body.

## For Example

We have some comments in the starter code for this lesson:

```java
public void initialLaunch() {
  // The background color
  screen.setBackgroundColor(Color.CYAN);

  // The corners - feel free to remove these!
  paint.setFillColor(Color.RED);
  paint.drawCircle(0, 0, 20);
}
```

## Comments in the Instructions

In the instructions you may see comments intended to inform you of where to add new code, for example:

```java
1  public void initialLaunch() {
2    // The background color
3    screen.setBackgroundColor(Color.CYAN);
4
5    //+ Add new code here!
6   
7    //
8
9    //- Remove this code
10   // The corners - feel free to remove these!
11   paint.setFillColor(Color.RED);
12   paint.drawCircle(0, 0, 20);
13   //
14 }
```

Here we should add new code on line 6, and remove the code from lines 10 to 13.

*This is just an example, there is nothing for you to do to your code here.*
