What we'd like to do next is add some **conditions** to our pen behavior. It should only draw when we hold left-click and drag the mouse, and it should only draw lines within the white sketchpad area.

In the next lesson we will learn to write `if-statements` and use **boolean logic** to define and enforce conditions.
