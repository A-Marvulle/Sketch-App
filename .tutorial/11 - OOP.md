# OOP - Object Oriented Programming

What we've just done, is implement the Object Oriented Programming pattern.

Java is designed to be built this way, so let's recap what we've accomplished:

1. We defined a **class** named `ClearButton`
2. This class contained **properties** and **methods** which defined the information it holds and the actions it can perform.
3. We instantiated an **object** which is of `ClearButton` type.
4. Our SketchPad called upon the actions of the `clearButton` object to make the button work.

## Takeaways

Each time you design something new in Java, you should start with a new file which contains a class. Each class should be responsible for a single purpose.

Once the class methods and properties are defined, you can create objects from that class to hold information and carry out those actions.

## In the next lesson

We will learn more about OOP and we'll create a second type of button that expands on our existing button design to allow the user to select pen colors.
