# Introduction

So far, our application performs the task it is meant to do, that is, drawing lines. Our next step is to make this program even more interactive for the user. A good place to start is to create clickable buttons that perform an action when pressed.

In this lesson, we will look at a button **class** and learn to create a button **object** which can be pressed to clear the page.

## Key Concepts
- Classes
- Objects
- Class type variables

## Lesson Objective

You will begin to see Java as an Object Oriented programming language. You will learn that a **class** is a data type which we can create. Once created, we can use a class to build complex variables called **objects** which will then have data they store about themselves and actions they can perform.
